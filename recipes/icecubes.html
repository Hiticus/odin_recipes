        <li>2 cups water (approximately)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)s</li>
    </ul>

        <li>PEmpty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.</li>
        <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).</li>
        <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
        <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
        <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
        <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>
